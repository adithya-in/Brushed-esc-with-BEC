# 🔋 NUKE LABS Brushed ESC — Minimal High-Power Motor Driver

A **bare-minimum brushed ESC** designed for **high-power RC airplane and drone applications**, built with a **single MOSFET topology** for simplicity, efficiency, and reliability.

> Most commercial brushed ESCs are overpriced, overcomplicated, and still lack proper current ratings.  
> This design by [NUKE LABS](https://github.com/nukelabs) fixes that — clean, cheap, powerful, and open-source.

## 🧩 Why This ESC?

Typical brushed ESCs include firmware (like BLHeli or DShot) and H-bridge drivers for bidirectional control — features that are **not needed for RC airplane propulsion**.  

This ESC:
- Uses only **one N-channel MOSFET** → higher current capacity, lower heat.
- Drops unnecessary **direction logic and MCU firmware** → simpler, cheaper, and more reliable.
- Adds a built-in **BEC regulator** → no external 5 V supply needed for flight controllers or receivers.
